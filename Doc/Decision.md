# Design Decision Made

The Application is meant to be worked as a Public network the main thing is that in the dapp the Doctors, Hospitals, Patients are the key peoples who is using it. The admin is the one who is deploying the contract and who has the authority to add hospitals. Each hospital Doctors and patients are given an uinique id as well as addresses to them. if anyone want to write something to the chain then they have to use thier key and the writing function in the contract is restricted by the modifier function.Except the writing restriction the other functionality is accesible to any one in the network, since this system is to bring transparent and tamper proof medical data management.
